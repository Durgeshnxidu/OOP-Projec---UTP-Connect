Description 

Our main purpose in developing this app is to convert every unorganized service that runs by students 
into an organized platform so their services can reach more other students/staff in UTP, and it will 
be easier to search. For example, many UTP students are doing grab services and just promoting it by 
Whatsapp text, but after a few days their customers couldn't find the text again, and it will take time 
to find it again. So, if we bring all the services provider into one app, the students/staff will find 
them more easily. Our first target is to convert this grab run by UTP students into an app, and later 
add more services that run UTP students such as clothing brands, food & more.
